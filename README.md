# Questionnaire-java-
Program: This program was created to poll a group of “users” of a series of 10 random questions. At the end of the Program a percentage will be shown to the voters on how many people voted yes and how many people voted no. UPDATE: Code has been changed so you can just click run and answer the question after it's done it will show you the results from when your vote is counted.
How to Run: To begin please press run. After the program has started you will be given a list of instructions asking how many voters/users there are. After that you may answer the questions with either yes or no. (CAPS will not matter).
Results: The results screen will display the percentage and the questions
